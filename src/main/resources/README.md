# About XSD Updates and Versioning


At any one time there may be several available versions of the XSD available for use:

* _Deprecated Version(s)_ - past version(s) of the XSD. While deprecated versions may still work, developers should be migrating to a current release version. New development should not be done against deprecated versions.
* _Release Version(s)_ - the XSD version you should be actively migrating to in order to take advantage of either improvements or new functionality.
* _One or more Release Candidates_ - these versions of the XSD contain in-progress improvements and functionality. They are made available to enable API users to take advantage of new functionality faster than waiting for the next Release Version. These versions are subject to change at any time.

_Which XSD version should I be using?_

The XSD version you should use depends on what you are trying to do. Most developers will use a current Release Version, or be actively migrating to one. However, if you are developing an integration that takes advantage of new functionality or improvement, you likely will need to use one of the Release Candidates.

## Staying informed

You can stay informed of updates to the XSD and API by subscribing to our [API Users Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/orcid-api-users) mailing list and forum.

## Using XSD versions

### <a name="deprecatedVersion"></a>Deprecated version(s)

The deprecated version(s) of the XSD are former versions of the XSD. If you are using a deprecated version, you should be planning a migration to move to a release version. Other things of note about deprecated versions:

* An XSD that has changed to deprecated status will not be removed immediately, though we are actively encouraging all developers to move to the current release version.
* Developers on deprecated versions should refer to the migration notes to assist in moving to the latest release version.
* Future functionality will not be supported in deprecated versions.
* Future versions may not be backward compatible with deprecated versions.
* Deprecated versions will have a "sunset date", after which they will no longer be supported. Developers experiencing problems with deprecated versions will be directed to move to the release version.

### <a name="releaseVersion"></a>Release version(s)

Release versions of the XSD are fully documented, tested, supported and encouraged for use. Of note about release versions:

* Our intent is for release versions of the XSD to have longer lifespans than the very fast pace of ORCID new development.
* When feasible, we will provide estimates of when the next release version is likely to be available, and what it is likely to contain.
* While more than one release version may be available at any time, we highly recommend that developers update to the latest release version at least once per year to enjoy optimal XSD stability.

### <a name="releaseCandidate"></a>Release candidate(s)

Release candidate versions of the XSD contain elements and data structures for future functionality, potential changes and other enhancements. Of note about release candidates:

* The version number of release candidates will contain "rc" to indicate that they are release candidates (for example, version 1.2_rc1). The first two numbers indicate the target release version for the candidate. For example, the changes and enhancements in version 1.2_rc1 are being considered for inclusion with release version 1.2.
* Release candidates are generally unsupported, and have limited documentation.
* Elements and data structure within a release candidate XSD could change at any time based on development needs and feedback from early adopters.
* We welcome feedback from any developers working with current release candidates.
